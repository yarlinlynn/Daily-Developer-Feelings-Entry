# ✨Daily Developer Feelings Entry
Welcome to **Daily Developer Feelings Entry** — an introspective web app for developers to track their emotions, document daily reflections, and celebrate personal growth through their coding journey.

<br/>

This project was inspired by [DailyFeelings](https://github.com/Btelgeuse/DailyFeelings), but redesigned with developers in mind. It encourages both beginner and experienced developers to check in emotionally, track their mental and technical progress, and build a healthy reflection habit while learning to code.
As a developer currently learning JavaScript in a coding bootcamp, this project also serves as a learning playground to practice DOM manipulation, styling, logic handling, and feature design.

## 👤 Who It's For

- 👩‍💻 Beginner developers navigating the early days of coding.
- 🧑‍💼 Developers learning new languages, frameworks, or working through difficult projects.
- 💬 Anyone who wants to reflect on their day-to-day emotional state and technical progress in the world of development.

<br/>

## ✅ Current Status

I’m currently working on:

- Creating a `new-entry.html` page where users:
  - Choose their emotions by clicking emoji buttons
  - See background colors change on hover using JavaScript
  - Select an emotion (active state coming soon!)
  - Enter a reflection and tomorrow's goal via two text fields

**Skills I'm currently learning:**
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Event listeners for hover/active states
- Saving entries to localStorage (coming soon!)
- Structuring HTML/CSS for responsive layout

You can see the current progress here:

<br/>

## 🌟 Planned Features

Here’s what I envision for the full experience as I grow:

### 💬 Entry System
- [x] Emotion buttons with hover states
- [ ] Click to activate one or more emotions
- [ ] Text fields for:
  - "Why I felt this way"
  - "My goal for tomorrow"
- [ ] Save entries to local storage or database

### 🎨 Interactive UI
- [ ] Typing text animation on the homepage with dynamic background colors
- [ ] Emotion-based color palette
- [ ] Accessibility-friendly layout and color contrast

### 📅 Dashboard View
- [ ] `dashboard.html` page showing all past entries by date
- [ ] Click a past entry to view your thoughts from that day
- [ ] Past entries displayed in a layout similar to the new-entry form (but read-only)

### 👥 User Authentication (Future Feature)
- [ ] Basic sign-up/login form (name + password)
- [ ] Option to sign in with Google (Firebase Authentication)
- [ ] Welcome message: "Welcome back, [Name]"

### 🧠 Multi-Emotion Support
- [ ] Allow selecting more than one emotion at once
- [ ] Tag entries with multiple feelings

<br/>

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for structure
- **CSS** – for layout and styling
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity (being learned and added gradually)
- **[Optional Future] Firebase** – for auth and data storage
- **[Optional Future] localStorage** – for temporary data saving while offline

## 💡 How to Use / Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yarlinlynn/Daily-Developer-Feelings-Entry.git
   cd Daily-Developer-Feelings-Entry
```

2. Open ```index.html``` in your browser to see the homepage.
3. Navigate to ```assets/pages/new-entry.html``` to try the emotion selector.

> Note: This is a personal learning project — the features are being developed step by step as I learn more JavaScript!
